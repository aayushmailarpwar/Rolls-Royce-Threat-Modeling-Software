Led a team of Computer Engineering students in developing an open-source threat modeling tool for Rolls Royce Engineering, aimed at users with limited or no experience in Security Engineering. The project, a part of the Senior year curriculum, involved utilizing Angular, HTML, and CSS, following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile Development principles. As the Lead Developer, responsibilities included designing a system to instill a threat modeling mindset in users, integrating libraries such as JointJs (an open-source diagramming tool) and node.js, conducting requirement analysis, and researching UI/UX for users with minimal knowledge of Threat Modeling. The goal was to produce an MVP of the Threat Modeling Software by May 2023, with the design plan and prototype expected to be completed by December 2022. The project was conducted as an open-source initiative under the sponsorship of Luke Thomas from Rolls Royce.
